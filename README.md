# Data_Analysis_Exercises

*Data Camp Intro*

"You've watched the movie Titanic by James Cameron (1997) again and after a good portion of sobbing you decide to investigate whether you'd have a chance of surviving this disaster.
To start your investigation, you decide to do some exploratory visualization with `ggplot()`. You have information on who survived the sinking given their age, sex and passenger class."

*Springboard Instructions:* 

1: Copy and paste the R code from the Titanic exercise in the ggplot2 tutorial into a file Titanic.R

2: Check in Titanic.R into your github repository.

3: Submit the link to the appropriate file or folder in your github repository.
